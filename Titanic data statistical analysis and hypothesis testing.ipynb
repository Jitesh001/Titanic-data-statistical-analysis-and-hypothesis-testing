    "The statistical analysis provides a summary of the key statistical measures for various numerical columns in the Titanic dataset. Here are some insights that can be drawn from the provided summary statistics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Survived:** The mean indicates that approximately 38% of the passengers survived. This suggests that the dataset is slightly imbalanced, with more non-survivors than survivors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Pclass (Passenger Class):** The mean value around 2.31 indicates that the majority of the passengers were in the second or third class. The standard deviation of 0.84 suggests a relatively wide distribution of passenger classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Age:** The mean age of approximately 29.7 suggests that the passengers were generally young adults. The standard deviation of 13.0 indicates a moderate amount of variability in ages. The minimum age of 0.42 suggests the presence of infants among the passengers.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Sibsp (Number of Siblings/Spouses Aboard):** The mean value of approximately 0.52 suggests that most passengers did not have siblings or spouses aboard. The maximum value of 8 indicates the presence of a few passengers with a large number of siblings or spouses.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Parch (Number of Parents/Children Aboard):** The mean value of 0.38 suggests that most passengers did not have parents or children aboard. The maximum value of 6 indicates the presence of a few passengers with a relatively large number of parents or children.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Fare:** The mean fare of approximately 32.20 suggests a moderately high fare on average. The wide standard deviation of 49.69 indicates a large variation in ticket prices, likely due to different passenger classes and other factors.\n"
